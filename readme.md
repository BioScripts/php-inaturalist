# php-inaturalist - php client and tools for the iNaturalist API

[iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org )  is one of the worldâ€™s most popular biodiversity resources. It provides a flexible [API](https://api.inaturalist.org/v1/docs/) for data management. There is some implementations of iNaturalist API client in various programming languages, but not in PHP. This project aims to develop a php client for the iNaturalist API, and data management applications based on it. This project not is a "monolith", and consists of a set of resources that can be used independently of each other:

## /lib: php client and additional function for data processing

### /lib/phpinaturalist_functions.php

php client functions for the iNaturalist API

#### Requirements for hpinaturalist_functions.php

PHP 5.6 or above with cURL

#### Implemented at the moment

* Authentication by Resource Owner Password Credentials Flow
* Endpoints:
  * POST/observations
  * POST/observation_field_value
  * POST/observation_photos
  * GET/taxa

These functions allows to construct some "pipeline" to create observations and add field values and photos.

### /lib/tools_functions.php

Function library for data processing

#### List of functions

* get_data_from_exif - prepare observation data (longitude, latitude, observed_on_string) in iNaturalist API compatible format from geotagged image.
* get_timezone_data - php client for time zone server (see "/time_zone_server" below) - allow to receive compatible with iNaturalist API time_zone name.

#### Requirements for tools_functions.php

PHP 5.6 or above with cURL and exif

## /time_zone_server: standalone server for determine the time zone by geographic longitude and latitude

The iNaturalist API endpoint [POST/observations](https://www.inaturalist.org/pages/api+reference#post-observations) requires the name of time zone according to fixed list of the names. In fact, this list of time zones is quite peculiar, and does not correspond to the names of the zones neither in [The Time Zone Database IANA](https://www.iana.org/time-zones), nor in various public services to determine time zones.  Thus, defining the time zone in a format compatible with the iNaturalist API is significantly complicated.

To solve this problem, a spatial MySQL database with time zone boundaries was created, and the interface to address it. The zone boundaries have been created based on the [TZ timezones of the world](http://efele.net/maps/tz/world/), the iNaturalist API zone names have been defined based on the [List of tz database time zones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) wikipedia page, [The Time Zone Database IANA](https://www.iana.org/time-zones)  and the [time.is](https://time.is/) service.

### Requirements

MySQl server (5.6 or above), PHP (5.6 or above with mysqli)

### Installation

1. Import timezone_database.sql in your MySQL database.
2. Create your own access token(s) in `tokens` table/
3. Put index.php (endpoint) on your web server.
4. Set actual values in "server configuration" section.
5. Your server is ready to use.

### Usage

Just send GET request to http(s):/path-where-your-endpoint-is-located/ with 3 parameters:

* `lon` - longitude in degrees (WGS) (between 180 and -180, e.g. -100.25)
* `lat` - latitude in degrees (WGS) (between 180 and -180, e.g. -100.25)
* `token` - alid token for access to the server

The result of your request will be json like:

```json
{

   "code":"200",

   "message":"time zone is defined",

   "result":{

      "ianaid":"Europe\/Volgograd",

      "inatid":"Volgograd",

      "utc_offset":"+04:00"

   }

}
```

where:

* `ianaid` - name of time zone in IANA database
* `inatid` - name of time zone in iNaturalist API list of time zones
* `utc_offset` - difference in hours and minutes from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)

If the request was unsuccessful - the server will return json with error code and its explanation.

The database does not include water area of seas and oceans, as well as Antarctica - in this case the server will return error code 400 and the message "longitude and latitude in the request is out of any time zone".
